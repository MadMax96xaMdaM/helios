# What is Helios?
Helios is a multi-source add-on for [wako](https://wako.app) with the added ability to install custom provider. Helios allows users to connect to multiple online/offline services at once for their viewing with a single click.

# Create your own provider
If you'd like to know how providers work and create your own, read the [wiki](https://github.com/wako-unofficial-addons/helios/wiki/Providers)

# Can I use Helios to illegally view copyrighted material?
I will not, and nor will I condone the use of Helios or any custom providers to view illegal copyright content. No assistance will be given to any user that I identify to be using Helios for illegal purposes. Please respect copyrighted work and any laws applicable to yourself whilst using Helios.
